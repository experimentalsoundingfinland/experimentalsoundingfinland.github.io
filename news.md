**ANNOUNCEMENT!** We have developed an event calendar for the sonic communities in Finland, the Experimental Sounding Finland (ESF) website!

https://experimentalsoundingfinland.github.io/

How does it work?

- For the **audience**: check the events and attend!

- For **artists**: there's a form to add your event. Your event will be shared with our friends at **[el채채.fi](https://elaa.fi/)**, who run a similar project (read below for the differences*), and with whom we have worked together. 

- For **organisers**: ESF has a section for venues and organisers, to add your venues, description, and contact information.

***Differences**: The ESF calendar is completely open with no curation, there's the possibility of downloading the archive of all events and venues, which is very important to document the communities' activities. El채채.fi is a curated calendar, a subjective selection of the events happening in Finland, according to their team's views. In the future, it will become a communal platform for curation.
