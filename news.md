Hey everybody! Since many months we have been developing an event calendar for the sonic communities in Finland, the Experimental Sounding Finland (ESF) website!

How does it work?

- For the **audience**: check the events and attend!

- For **artists**: there's a form to add your event. Your event will be shared with our friends at [el채채.fi](https://elaa.fi/), who run a similar project (read below for the differences), and with whom we have worked together. 

- **Differences**: The ESF calendar is completely open with no curation, there's the possibility of downloading the archive of all events and venues, which is very important to strengthen the community. El채채.fi is a curated calendar, a subjective selection of the events happening in Finland, according to their team's views. In the future, it will become a communal platform for curation.

- For **organisers**: ESF has a section for venues and organisers, to add your venues, description, and contacts.
