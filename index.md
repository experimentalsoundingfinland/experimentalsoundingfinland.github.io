This website provides a shared [calendar](calendar.md) for the activities of the sonic practices communities active in Finland.
It is a place to show your events (performance, workshop, etc.) but also to easily find what and when other people are doing something public.

'Sonic practices' are meant here in the widest possible understanding, such as:
- Experimental
- Audio-visual
- Sound and movement
- Real-time
- Performative
- Improvisatory

## Rules and criteria 
- No aesthetic filters
- No nazis
- No offensive, discriminatory, violent content

## How to add an event
On [this page](calendar.md), currently under construction

## Contact us
On [this page](contact.md), currently under construction. Please keep in mind that this site is a community service - we will try to answer you quickly, but sometimes it might take a few days.
