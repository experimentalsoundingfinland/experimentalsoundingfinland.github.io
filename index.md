This website provides a shared **[calendar](calendar.md)** for the activities of the creative sonic communities active in Finland.
It is a place to show your events (performance, workshop, etc.) but also to easily find what and when other people are doing something public.

  - Experimental
  - Audio-visual
  - Sound and movement
  - Real-time
  - Performative
  - Improvisatory
- No nazis
- No offensive, discriminatory, violent content
