EVENING, WINDOW is the debut full-length album by Helsinki-based sound artist and ambient composer miska lamberg. Working with intricate field recordings that gather the overlooked moments of daily life—rainfall, distant traffic, animal calls—lamberg threads these textures into compositions that ache with personal memory. On EVENING, WINDOW, the familiar becomes spectral: fragments of sound blur into melody and mood, capturing the stark melancholy of Nordic winters and the soft violence of remembering.  
  
The event is free of charge, but consider buying a coffee.
