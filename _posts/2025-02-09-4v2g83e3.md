The recent political events surrounding X and Meta have given new urgency to the issues behind corporate social media and their unethical, politically unviable and unsustainable practices. Many among us have expressed their wish to leave, but are facing disorientation, fear of isolation and loss of connection as well as useful organisational tools.  
  
We would like to invite you all (artists, organisers, audiences or simply curious people) to participate to an informal open discussion on these themes, where we can voice concerns, discuss alternatives and possible strategies, or simply get together and have tea or coffee and celebrate the improvements in the heating system ðŸ”¥.  
  
In particular, we are interested in discussing with the sonic communities, fears, wishes, and needs in this regard and hopefully start imagining together some alternatives to corporate solutions, with special attention to open source, decentralised tools for building and consolidating our communities, online and offline.  
  
The event will also be streamed.Â Broadcast stream and recording by Station of Commons.
