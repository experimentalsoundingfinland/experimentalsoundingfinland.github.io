VIKTOR TOIKKANEN  
Viktor Toikkanen is a composer, musician, and multimedia artist from Helsinki, Finland, with over a decade of experience in the city's electronic and experimental music scene. He holds a Master of Music from the Department of Music and Technology at Sibelius Academy and has studied multimedia composition at Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. His work spans film, electronic music, multimedia art, computer-assisted chamber music, and performance. A former drummer, Toikkanen has recently reconnected with the instrument.  
  
Navigating naturally between electronic music, multimedia, contemporary classical, free improvisation, and performance art, Toikkanen refuses to adhere to a single style, constantly seeking new ways of self-expression. He has collaborated with various ensembles, and his music has been released and performed internationally. Toikkanen has also worked as an event organizer, curator, sound engineer, and workshop leader. He views his art as a diary—an ongoing reflection of a specific time and place, shaped by the interests and resonances that move him in the moment.
