This concert explores a rich spectre of contemporary virtuosity in solo violin Caprices, Etudes, and Studies written in the past 50 years.   
  
Exploration invites the performer to create a range of sound worlds and stage personae while the audience explores the edges of possibilities of the violin in a contemporary music performance setting.â€¯
