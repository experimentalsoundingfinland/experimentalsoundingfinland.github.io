About:  
  
Swedish alto saxophonist Marcus Wärnheim and Finnish double bass player Jonathan Bäckström have been playing together as a duo since 2018. Through a long-lasting close collaborative process they are consequently pushing the limits of the intimate duo setting, exploring sound by embracing the spontaneous, pre-determined and arbitrary.

MARUCS WÄRNHEIM is a Swedish alto saxophonist and improviser, currently based in Amsterdam. His artistic output is primarily based in a genuine curiosity of sound, which he works with through intense listening and a thorough research of the physical possibilities of his instrument. In recent years he has been preoccupied with acoustic solo performances, improvisational meetings, interpretation of other’s compositions as a sideman, as well as trans-disciplinary collaborations with dancers and circus artists.

ANNIKA FUHRMANN is a German-Finnish versatile singer, musician, and sound artist, who feels most at home in the fields of experimental music theater, sound art, improvisation, and contemporary music. Annika graduated from the Sibelius Academy with a master’s degree in music. In recent years, she has actively sought to break away from her classical singing background. Instead of technical perfection, she is interested in the diverse use of the human voice as an expressive tool with a direct and unadorned connection to the listener.
