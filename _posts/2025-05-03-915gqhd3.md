bugbath: questing-questing is an evening arranged around tales told through murmuring music, notional noise and skittering sound.  
  
The lineup features performances by sofi, Kofu, Dylan Kerr, and Murrettumeri. The eveningâ€™s program has been curated by Atte Elias Kantonen  
  
ðŸ”¸Program:  
  
sofi (Sofia Zaiceva) is a sound artist and performer hailing from Latvia. At the event, sofiâ€™s performance is a synthetic sonic terrain of algorithms, an uncanny valley between the familiar and the alien.  
  
Kofu, artistic alias for Moriamo Ahmed, is a Finnish-born Nigerian poet, musician, and DJ. Kofu brings their EP to life, leaving behind the shell of an apathetic being behind them and embodying the message the music encompasses.   
  
Dylan Kerr is a performance artist/vocalist/composer based between Ireland and Berlin. Dylan Kerr will present â€˜substratumâ€™, a composition for voice and fixed electronics that draws inspiration from the Hindustani Dhrupad tradition.   
  
Murrettumeri is a musical artist, sound designer, and a performance artist working with music and contemporary theatre. Murrettumeri PLAYS DRUMS LIVE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ELECTRONIC MUSIC IS (FINALLY) JUXTAPOSED WITH ACOUSTIC DRUMS?
