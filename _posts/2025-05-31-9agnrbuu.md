Do we see the same colors, or are we just naming the same color names?  
COLORWASH is a proposal for perceiving colors and the themes they reflect. Three performers  
have chosen six colors. By exploring various ways of seeing and observing color, the performance  
channels these themes through sound, visual art, and gesture.  
We invite the audience to ponder with us: What do you see in these colors? What do colors tell  
you? What do colors sound like?
