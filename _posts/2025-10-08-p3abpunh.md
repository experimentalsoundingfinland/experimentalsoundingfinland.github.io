Suhina Klubi serves as a platform for improvised and experimental music and sound art within Helsinki. During the year 2025 we present improvised music ensembles from Finland and abroad.  
  
In the third edition of Suhina Klubi for the fall 2025, we are  
proud to host Johannes Sarjasto & Tapani Varis.  
Johannes Sarjasto is a saxophonist who has played a wide variety of music over the years. He has been involved in different bands and projects ranging from jazz to Afrobeat, experimental music, and free improvisation. At the moment, he plays actively with Oiro Pena, whose music has been described as underground, outsider, and low-quality folk music, but also as energetic, cosmic, and spiritually warm.  
  
Tapani Varis is a composing and improvising multi-instrumentalist.  
His selection of instruments includes folk wind instruments, especially overtone-based long flutes and the jew’s harp. In addition to these, Tapani is often seen playing double bass or electric bass, or the bass harmonica in different ensembles. At Suhina Klubi, it’s likely that some of the aforementioned instruments will be heard.  
  
Suhina Klubi is supported by Kone foundation and city of Helsinki  
Concert starts at 7pm  
Tickets: 15€/8
