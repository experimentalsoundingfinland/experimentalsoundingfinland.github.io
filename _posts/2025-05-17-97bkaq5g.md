Atte Häkkinen is a musician and media artist who has been performing experimental electronic music live since 2009. Häkkinen uses synthesizers, drum machines and self-programmed instruments in his performances. His material has ranged from noise music to ambient, but the searching, experimentation and discovery of new sounds has been with him from the beginning.  
  
In the concert at the Sibelius Museum, Häkkinen improvises acoustically on instruments designed by Juhani Pohjanmies, inspired by the museum’s Pohjanmies exhibition.  
  
The concert takes place at 20:00-20:45.
