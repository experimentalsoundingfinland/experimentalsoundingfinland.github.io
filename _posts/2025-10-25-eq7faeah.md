*************************  
  
Richard Bishop is probably best known for his 26 year involvement with the band Sun City Girls and as an experimental solo guitarist whose work often reflects the shadow worlds of India, the Middle East, North Africa, and other points along the Gypsy trail. Bishop’s first solo record, Salvador Kali, was released by John Fahey’s esteemed Revenant Records label in 1998. It was issued under the name of Sir Richard Bishop and the name stuck.  
  
In 2005, Bishop began performing full time as a solo artist, playing throughout Europe and the United States. The 2025 European tour is his first solo acoustic tour in 10 years. He will be playing solo acoustic guitar, focusing on new material and improvisation. His latest LP "Hillbilly Ragas" is released by Drag City in September.
