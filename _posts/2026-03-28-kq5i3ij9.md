NOTE! New date!  
  
Artsy Records celebrates its 10th anniversary with three performances at the atmospheric El Fant restaurant in Helsinki in March. The evening will feature three duos.  
  
Matti Luokkanen and Samuli Tanner's 2021 cassette "Kvanillo" was significant in Artsy's history in that it marked the beginning of a more determined approach to releasing music. The duo's music, which unhurriedly but dynamically combines saxophones and electronics, was so captivating that it simply had to be released.  
  
Kuupuu (Jonna Karanka) and Amon Düde (Arttu Partinen) have a shared musical history spanning about a quarter of a century. They have long served as the "sound effects department" for Hockey Night, but this is their first ever duo gig.  
  
Memory Dreams, often described as vaporwave, represents Artsy's more recent phase. Their long-sold-out cassette "Scorpion?" also reflects Artsy's operating principle, as the duo, who had only released one song at that point, were asked to make an entire release based on that one piece. Audiovisual VHS aesthetics play a central role in Memory Dreams' expression, and they even have a special concept in store for the El Fant show!
