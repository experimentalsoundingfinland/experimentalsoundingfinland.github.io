JUHO TUOMAINEN  
Juho Tuomainen is an ambient guitarist who creates improvised atmospheres as a vehicle for meditation. His calm and contemplative sound reflects his feelings on the impermanence of the human condition, as well as his affection towards the delicate nature of Japanese aesthetics. With a creative use of a looper, he likes to build imaginary environments, while letting the music breathe and speak for itself. Through his music, Juho wants to bring us back to our innermost questions and remind us that we are here only for a short while.  
On December 15th 2024 Juho Tuomainen released the first single from his upcoming album.  
  
TEEA AARNIO & WILSON TANNER SMITH  
Teea Aarnio and Wilson Tanner Smith represents a delicate meeting of many musical backgrounds across improvisation, electronics and interdisciplinary performance.  
Smith is a cellist, composer, and multi-instrumentalist from the contemporary and free jazz/free improvisation communities of Chicago, with a sensitive approach to sound and space, often creating work for site-specific performances drawing from the latent sound, historical, and cultural associations of a given place and moment.  
Aarnio is a global-facing Helsinki based vocalist, composer, improviser, songwriter, activist and interdisciplinary artist. Her works draws inspiration from the various never-ending decolonial processes, and the wide experience that she holds from working with different art forms. She's especially passionate about exploring all the possibilities that voice holds within an instrumentalist approach.  
Her trilingual folk fusion debut album 'Väki' has received international praise and interest.
