Ryosuke Kiyasu is a pioneering snare drum soloist who has redefined percussion since 2003. Alongside his solo shows, he drums for noise-grind duo SETE STAR SEPT, the Kiyasu Orchestra, Keiji Haino’s Fushitsusha, and has co-founded Canada’s cult hardcore unit The Endless Blockade. With 200-plus releases spanning solo work and band discographies, Kiyasu continues to tour globally, delivering a singular, high-impact blend of extreme dynamics, physicality, and avantgarde vision that has made the snare drum a headline instrument.
