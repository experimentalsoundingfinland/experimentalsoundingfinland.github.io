RE-DEFINING - Äänen Lumo - Gon Muruaga & Axel Filip  
  
Welcome to the Äänen Lumo concert in Toinen kerros!  
  
Drummer-electronic artist Axel Filip and electric-guitarist-sound-designer Gon Muruaga fuse rich textures, deep rhythms, and spontaneous interplay into an immersive soundscape where acoustic and electronic worlds collide.  
  
Exploration, groove, and atmosphere take center stage—then a third, autonomous performer (a system trained in real time during the show) joins the dialogue, adding an ever-shifting layer that makes each performance truly unique experience.  
  
Axel Filip — drums & electronics  
  
Argentinian drummer, composer and improviser Axel Filip has been based in Berlin since 2020. Known for fluidly moving between jazz, Argentine folk, avant-garde and electronics, he has appeared on 20+ albums as a sideman and as a leader, including the 2021 solo set Sendero. Live, Filip expands the kit with live-sampling and modular effects, crafting dense rhythmic textures that have featured at Donau115 (Berlin), TOMA (Buenos Aires) and European improv festivals.  
  
Gon Muruaga — electric guitar & electronics  
  
Born in Argentina and now based in Helsinki, electric-guitarist and composer Gon Muruaga Olguin blends contemporary jazz harmony with real-time signal processing and ambisonic sound design. After completing studies in Contemporary Music (Estonia) he focused on different projects with improvisation, contemporary music and multichannel composing.
