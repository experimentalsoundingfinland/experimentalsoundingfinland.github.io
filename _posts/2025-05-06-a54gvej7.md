About murmur trio: [https://liberomureddu.github.io/murmurtrio/](https://liberomureddu.github.io/murmurtrio/)  
  
murmur Trio was founded in 2023 during a typically hot summer in Milan. The trio includes longstanding friend, collaborator, and wonderful drummer Cristiano Calcagnile ([https://www.cristianocalcagnile.eu/)](https://www.cristianocalcagnile.eu/)) and the upcoming Italian double bass star Andrea Grossi ([https://andreagrossiofficial.com/).](https://andreagrossiofficial.com/).)  
  
The trio was born out of the idea of experimenting with the format of a jazz piano trio but using a physically-modelled piano instead of an acoustic one. We liked the music and decided to continue playing together! Thanks to a fortunate alignment of geography, time, and stars the three of us will be in Finland at the same time, and we decided to have a concert at (my) home.  
  
murmur trio investigates the space where purely and intentionally electronic practices intersect with the long shadow of the jazz piano trio. How do we react to this potential friction? How do the acoustic and electronic worlds influence each other? What (im)possibilities lie ahead of us? murmur is a laboratory of sounds and real-time approaches, an experiment in continuous evolution, a journey that attempts to drive the listener off the beaten path, even venturing into the impassable ones. murmur trio's debut album is almost ready and will be released during the next months.
