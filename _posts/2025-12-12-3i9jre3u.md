On Friday 12th, electroacoustic music and live improvisation meet at the heart of the city’s nightlife — Post Bar.  
  
The evening, curated by Tara Jovana Valkonen, opens with Jovanka Trbojević’s Le fantôme du vent — music of invisible kinetic energy, built on an electronic tape created by attaching a microphone to a figure skater’s skate to capture the sounds of gliding, jumping, and ice.  
Limite Circulaire, for flute and tape, explores the boundary between body and machine, between impulse and control: how can sound circulate, collide, and ultimately break through its own limits?  
Finally, Pierre Jodlowski’s intense collaboration with clarinetist Ángel Molinos combines live electronics, amplified bass clarinet, and virtuosic improvisation.  
  
The concert travels from ghostly spatiality toward a furious outburst of energy — until the beast is slowly unleashed.  
  
Avanti! is delighted to welcome French composer and performer Pierre Jodlowski to Helsinki. Jodlowski will appear in two club concerts on Friday, December 12, and Saturday, December 13. See also Avanti! Club on Saturday: Tara Jovana Valkonen.
