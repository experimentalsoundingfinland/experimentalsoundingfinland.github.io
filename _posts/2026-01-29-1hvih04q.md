Pianist Robert Fleitz’s chaotic and surprising doctoral recital, featuring works by Simon Bahr, Brian Dozier Brown, Nino Hellberg, James Layton, Tania Leon, Lena Raine, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Yuri Umemoto, Jasna Veličković, Jennifer Walshe, and Akiko Yamane.   
  
The concert explores how hybridity allows for infinite possibilities for the audience, and deeply personal expression by the composers. The piano becomes a vehicle for authenticity, each composition rewriting its own story: sometimes becoming a cathedral, sometimes a diary, and sometimes a game console.
