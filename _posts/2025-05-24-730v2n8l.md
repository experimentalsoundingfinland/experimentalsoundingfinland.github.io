In the concert, Ääni-ilmiö creates musical works inspired by poems or texts brought by the audience. The pieces are born in the moment through improvisation, emerging from the interaction between the ensemble and the audience, as well as between text and music. The Ääni-ilmiö collective explores the dimensions and communicative nature of the human voice and is not afraid to voice their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Their use of the voice is surprising, ever-changing, and stripped of aesthetic ideals. The texts serve as inspiration, material, and means of expression for the musical pieces in the concert.  
Bring a poem or text you would like to hear transformed into music by Ääni-ilmiö!  
  
Ääni-ilmiö is an improvising vocal collective founded in 2022, with 6 highly trained artists and professionals in vocal improvisation. The Ääni-ilmiö collective explores the dimensions and possibilities of the human voice through improvisation and draws on the communicative nature of the voice and the power of emotional expression. They combine a researcher’s curiosity with various forms of audience participation in their creative work.  
  
Performing in the concert are Ääni-ilmiö’s improvisers: Tua Hakanpää, Satu Tillanen, Johanna Vahtola, Heliä Mailiis Viirakivi, and Sanna Vuolteenaho.  
  
Concert is supported by the City of Espoo
