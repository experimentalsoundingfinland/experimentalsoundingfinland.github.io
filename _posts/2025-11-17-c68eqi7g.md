Nuo Nuohoojat  
  
The music of the Nuo Nuohoojat trio is created through free improvisation. Central to the band's expression are small, delicate, and incomplete sounds. The small sounds are treated as if they were decimals of whole sounds. Thus, the whole sounds are the sum of their parts, the combined result of the musicians' gestures and interaction. The Nuo Nuohoojat trio's first performance was heard at the Kaekuu festival in Sammatti in July 2025.   
  
Jaakko Kuikka - shakuhachi, saxophone  
Melik Turunen - synthesizer  
Johanna Vahtola - vocals, percussion  
  
  
LOPUT entertains its audience with standards that have become classics, such as at times thumping steady beat or hit melodies produced by the human voice. So it is expected to turn out hits with unpredictable themes.  
  
Ville Granroth - Human Voice  
Olli Haveri - Electric Mandolin and Violin  
Pekka Parviainen - Bass  
Mika Minkkinen - Drum Machine  
Jukka Laine - Effects  
  
Free admission.  Warmly welcome!
