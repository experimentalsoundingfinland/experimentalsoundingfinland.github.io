Composer-researcher Zeynep Toraman performing excerpts from her upcoming solo album Afterimages, an eclectic take on electroacoustic music in song form. The set brings together voice, synthesizers, electric guitar, strings and field recordings, creating textured and immersive soundscapes of resonance and memory, exploring the afterimage as a perceptual residue. Toraman is a composer and scholar from Istanbul, Turkey, living and working in Berlin.
