Laura Mehmeti is a Swiss artist, improviser and accordionist. A graduate of the Hochschule Luzern in the class of Anne-Maria Hölscher, she continues her studies at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki in the class of Veli Kujala.  
This concert explores the fragile and intimate relation between the voice and the instrument, how they merge, imitate, and extend one another. The performer is not only an instrumentalist but a whole body in motion, where gesture, breath, and sound become inseparable.

Composer-researcher Zeynep Toraman performing excerpts from her upcoming solo album Afterimages, an eclectic take on electroacoustic music in song form. The set brings together voice, synthesizers, electric guitar, strings and field recordings, creating textured and immersive soundscapes of resonance and memory, exploring the afterimage as a perceptual residue. Toraman is a composer and scholar from Istanbul, Turkey, living and working in Berlin.
