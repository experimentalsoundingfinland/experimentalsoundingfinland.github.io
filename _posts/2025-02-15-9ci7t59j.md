KATI ROOVER is a Helsinki-based, multidisciplinary artist. Her practice spans across the mediums of moving image, sound, photography, text and installations, draws upon and addresses a broad range of topics that are connected - from human, place and elemental interactions, mythopoetics, animisms and hydrofeminism, to the natural sciences and ecology.

MIIO HOLOPAINEN is a musician, composer and sound designer. Their music and performance works often deal with the cultural tensions of their instruments, concert space and sounds. They are for example interested in “failure” that can happen during bow turns and instruments that in their own ways fail as fiddles but have something special as individuals. Their music pays attention to small but significant changes, decay, details and slow ways of becoming another. Scarcity, coincidence, susurrus, fumbling, mundaneness, simplicity and dust are present.  
  
Miio Holopainen, violins, viola  
  
J. KOHO works extensively with sound. Koho’s listening based artistic practice combines the methods, techniques and theories of acoustic, concrete, electronic, electroacoustic music and improvisation.
