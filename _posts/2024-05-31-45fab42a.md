For her first doctoral concert Livia Schweizer will present a version of the ’Thirteen Changes’ by Pauline Oliveros collaborating with other six musicians and improvisers.  
The score will be explored and performed by various combinations of musicians and instruments within the group, ranging from solos and duos to tutti. Each piece will serve as an opportunity for every player to delve into diverse ’encounters’ between sonorities, personalities, aesthetics, and musical languages. This approach aims to celebrate the interaction of different aesthetics and individual voices united by a shared score, enabling multiple narratives to coexist.  
  
For example, what would you do if you would be asked to play a piece about 'rollicking monkeys landing on Mars'?   
  
performers:   
Livia Schweizer, flutes and concept   
Hepa Heikki Halme, flutes, and bass clarinet and objects  
Iida-Vilhelmiina Sinivalo, cello    
Melisa Yldirim, kamancha    
Mehrnoosh Zolfaghari, santur    
Libero Mureddu, piano   
Turkka Inkilä, electronics and shakuhachi
