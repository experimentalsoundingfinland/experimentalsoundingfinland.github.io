Mark is a sound researcher, performer, and ethnomusicologist who has explored overtone singing techniques since the 1990s. In the workshop, you’ll dive into the world of overtones and resonance — learning to listen deeply, explore and expand the expressive range of your own voice, employing a wide range of guttural techniques from Tibet, Mongolia and Tyva.   
  
In concert, Mark takes the audience on an immersive sonic journey where overtones, instruments, and the embodied voice intertwine in fascinating ways.
