Microtonal composer Sebastian Dumitrescu will perform his newest piece, ”Arrhythmia”. ”Arrhythmia” is an attempt at finding expressive harmony in the tuning system of 31 equal divisions of the octave. It is an interactive composition that uses live electronics, where both the performer and the computer react to the notes that the other one is playing.  
  
The concert will also feature a semi-improvised performance in Just Intonation by Dumitrescu and guitarist Mark Reid Bulatović.
