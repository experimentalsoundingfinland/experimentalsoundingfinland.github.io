Suhina Klubi serves as a platform for improvised and experimental music and sound art within Helsinki. During the year 2025 we present improvised music ensembles from Finland and abroad.  
  
In the fourth edition of Suhina Klubi for the fall 2025, we are  
proud to host Brad Henkel & Jukka Kääriäinen.  
  
Brad Henkel is an American trumpeter and composer currently based in Berlin, Germany. His primary focus is on improvisation, drawing on a wide spectrum of timbres from both composed and non-composed sounds. He creates and performs music rooted in a combination of jazz, contemporary music, and the Echtzeitmusik tradition. He is a member of the KIM Collective.
