Kukkapilli is an interdisciplinary project by artist duo Armi Teva and Anna-Sofia Anttonen. Teva creates ceramic instruments, which Anttonen uses to compose and perform music.  
  
Kukkapilli: Terde is an exhibition installation at Kallio’s Kalleria Gallery. The exhibition space brings together Teva’s ceramic works and a soundscape composed by Anttonen. In live performances, Anttonen plays songs combining wind instruments with live electronics.
