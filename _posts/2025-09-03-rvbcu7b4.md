Cristian Subirà - Signal Extraction presentation  
  
Signal Extraction" is a 20-minute sound piece created from recordings in Sipoonkorpi National Park and its edges, where trees functioned as natural antennas to capture non-audible electromagnetic frequencies using a custom-built device. The project listens to how noise, energy, and human infrastructures seep across boundaries, questioning what it means for a space to be 'protected,' while also inviting us to hear the subtle ways technology and extractivism shape even our most remote environments.  
  
Supported by the Kone Foundation.  
  
Cristian Subirà uses diverse mediums to investigate how sound interconnects with fields such as ecology, urban development, and tourism, while maintaining a critical stance toward technology. Committed to hybridization and collaborative practices, his body of work is characterized for being minimal, rough, amateurish, economical, ironic, simple, and intimate.  
As a music producer, under his alter ego Jason Kolàr, he explores electronica, Fourth World, abstract percussion, and generative music, often blending these elements to create a porous bridge between genres.
