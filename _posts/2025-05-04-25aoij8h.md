Harri Sjöström, Els Vandeweyer, Libero Mureddu, Ville Herrala are among the most innovative voices in contemporary improvised music and can now be heard as a quartet at the Sibelius Museo, Turku, as part of a project initiated by Harri Sjöström.  
  
As improvisers, composers, sound researchers and teachers, the four renowned musical personalities have been working independently for decades on music that leaves conventions behind.  
  
On this evening, they will engage in a complex and virtuoso exchange of their innovative and style-defining positions. With an unreserved, open playing attitude and extended playing techniques, they enhance the ensemble sound to a performative fullness.  
  
The audience can look forward to a rousing and inspiring sound experience!
