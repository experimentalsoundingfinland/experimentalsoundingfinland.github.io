alya grad  
  
The sonic signature of alya grad embraces raw aesthetics and an experimental approach. Touched by industrial tones, it blends digital textures, noise, and rhythm into layered contrasts — where softness meets rough sonic edges.

HUR HUR  
  
Hur Hur is a solo music project started in 2012 by multidisciplinary artists Timo Viialainen (FIN). It is based on the experimental use of an electroacoustic alto hurdy gurdy. Hurdy gurdy is drone based instrument mostly used in folk music but here it is used to create an immersive droney wall of sound that also contains hints of melodic repetative parts and rythms that come and go. Live gigs are very intense mix of improvisation and musically meaninful dramaturgy that slowly builds up to cathartic heights.  
  
Hur Hur has played live in different festivals and events in Europe and North America.

MATHIEU SYLVESTRE  
  
Field recordings and analog synthesizers are the main sources of sound processed by Mathieu Sylvestre. Noises and natural sounds are interwoven and articulated in electrified sound narratives between aural synesthesia and spatial vibrations.  
The sound performance is based on the contribution of tape recorded sounds and analogue modules, arranged by improvised motifs that evolve from show to show.  
In this way, the treatment of sound focuses on a plastic and physical approach to highlight the materiality of the boundaries between analogue acoustic textures and synthetic sources.
