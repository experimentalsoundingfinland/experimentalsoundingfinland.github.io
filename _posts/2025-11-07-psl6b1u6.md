Resonance is a multi-format event concept that reflects on current topics happening here and elsewhere, and on how they propagate and resonate around us. Resonance's first edition is presented in a festival format on the theme of Panic Archive.  
  
We live in a time when existence is saturated with the reverberations of crises and the residues of toxicity. They are persistent, mutable, and deeply felt. Within these resonant conditions, panic moves through us. It is not a singular episode but a continuous and circulating current. Panic is archived not as a discrete event but as a living force, manifesting in gestures, in sound, in silence, in fleeting moments of tension, and in the tremors of bodies and spaces. The first edition of Resonance, Panic Archive, explores collective and individual unrest, anxiety, and fear, examining how these shared states are transmitted, recorded, and transformed across various contexts.  
  
In Resonance Vol. 1, eight acts take over the industrial space of Puristamo in Cable Factory (Kaapelitehdas) for two nights, November 7 and 8, through experimental music, sound art, and movement, and invite the audience into a multisensory environment to experience this layered emotion and sensitive theme.
