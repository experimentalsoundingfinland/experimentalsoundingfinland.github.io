Rahina-klubi: LAPONIA IMPROVISATIONS  
  
The Laponia Improvisations collective will perform a body of work in which the composed and the improvised merge together.  The materials in this piece of  work were created during Pauli Lyytinen's improvisation course in early 2025. The theme of the course was complex rhythms and strong melodies as a source of improvisation. The concert will premiere compositions by each performer.  
  
Joona Hulmi - piano  
Santeri Kaipiainen - vocals  
Jaakko Kuikka - saxophone  
Juha Rautio - guitar  
Alejandro Sanchez - guitar  
Pauli Lyytinen - director
