The Rahina Club brings together four musicians who have not met for 40 years, 4 months, or something in between!  
Jone Takamäki has been at the forefront of Finnish free musical expression since the 1980s. In addition to saxophones and clarinet, he is known as a master of Japanese wooden flutes.  
... "Takamäki's expression penetrates all defenses and learned patterns of behavior."  
  
Lauri Hyvärinen's main sound source is the guitar. In his playing, he utilizes the possibilities of improvisation, composition, and minimalist structures in his search for common and enhanced social and spatial structures.  
..." the guitar sound was excitingly rough and the chords were unique"  
  
Jukka-Pekka Kervinen is a Finnish composer, visual artist, and experimental poet and musician. Kervinen's latest sonic adventure, Narella (Egdetone Records), is a deeply captivating dive into the art of experimental sound collage. This musical journey crosses genre and texture boundaries and creates a rich, impactful experience for everyone.  
  
Vesa Lehko is interested in exploring the boundaries of music and various sound   
phenomena through improvisation. In addition to playing woodwinds, found sounds and objects, he runs the experimental music, improvisation and sound art club Rahina in Merihaka, Helsinki.  
  
Free admission. Warm welcome!
