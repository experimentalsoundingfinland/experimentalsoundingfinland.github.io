Circle’s PISTE exhibition at the Pori Art Museum will also serve as a venue for a series of musical visits and interventions, kind of artistic intermissions. The series of performances will begin on Thursday 13 February at 16:00 with Anla Courtis and Tomutonttu. The artists have been invited by Jussi Lehtisalo of Circle and Ektro Records. The performances are included in the price of the museum ticket.  
  
Anla Courtis is a musician and composer from Buenos Aires. Courtis’ experimental music combines sound samples and manipulations with both traditional and special, self-made, instruments. Courtis has released hundreds of recordings as a solo artist and in numerous collaborative projects. He is a founding member of the Argentinian 90’s cult band Reynols.  
  
Tomutonttu is a solo project by Tampere-based multi-artist Jan Anderzén. Anderzén, a visual artist working with textiles, drawings, prints and sound sculptures, is as a musician best known for his work with the band Kemialliset Ystävät, founded in 1995. Tomutonttu’s music is a collage of different sounds, sometimes recognisable from the animal world, and electronic experimental music.
