In the quiet of mid-winter, the 10th edition of Something Else veers towards the warm, meditative, and ambient with a duo of Varis (sax/electronics) and Wilson Tanner Smith (cello/electronics).   
Tonight also celebrates the release of Smith's new solo album "Perpetual Guest," which features improvisations on cello and an antique harmonium at the Kreenholm Factory in Narva, Estonia, created in the silence of the abandoned factory a stone's throw from Estonia's fraught border with Russia. Special price for physical CDs tonight only!  
  
Free entry, suggested donation €5-€500 (mobilepay or cash)  
2 sets

SOMETHING ELSE is a concert series for improvised music focused on new meetings of musicians from across Helsinki's free improv, experimental, jazz, electronic, and global music communities, hosted on the 4th Thursday of each month at Kallio's Musta Kissa bar. New small-ensemble groupings are highlighted each time, with an emphasis on surprise, difference, curiosity, energy, and connection. Curated/hosted by Wilson Tanner Smith.
