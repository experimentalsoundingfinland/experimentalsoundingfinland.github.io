Tara's description of the club:  
“I designed December’s Avanti Club to overcome the darkness of early winter; to make you smile, maybe even shed a few tears, perhaps raise some questions, and even get your tiny dancing feet to twitch just a little.  
  
Welcome to hear some fifths, loops, and even a few melodic riffs!”
