Maja Ambient is an experimental sound piece that invites listeners to connect with their environment through sound. It will take place on 30 August and is organised by Maja Coffee Roastery (Kaya Nishikori and Tapani Huovinen). The event explores how the environment resonates with the human subconscious, aiming to evoke a feeling in those arriving — gently preparing them for a shift in time and space.  
  
Held on Lasipalatsi Square, the program features seven artists and collectives working at the intersection of sound, performance, and sensory experience. Through continuous ambient soundscapes and site-specific performances, Maja Ambient encourages a heightened awareness of space, time, and community.  
  
Artists:  
Olli Aarni, Marja Ahti, Hanten Bureau, Koekeittiö / Test Kitchen, Patrick Kosk, Mikko Kuorinki, and Tuomas Toivonen.
