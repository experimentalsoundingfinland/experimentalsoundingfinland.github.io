PLEASE NOTE! THIS IS THE CORRECT DATE, NO CONCERT ON 29.5.  
  
BROMP TREB (US)  
MUSA DWARF  
BOOM EDAN  
  
Tickets 10€  
  
Mental Alaska and El Fant bring experimental music to Market Square!  
  
Since 2002 Los Angeles-based artist Neil Young aka Neil ‘Cloaca’ Young has been performing and recording as Bromp Treb, a nonsense onomatopoeia for the rattling windows of a jalopy with an overenthusiastic subwoofer. Working through an improvised maze of crooked rhythms and tangled textures, Young uses his voice/body, synthesis, tapes, percussion, drum machines and whatever else is available to squish time and space back into the hilariously delicate traps of decorum and order. The spring is never coiled up tight enough. Noise is joyful failure music.  
  
Musa Dwarf is a duo by Antti Vuornos and Hilma Camus (G-Litter, Pyloris). Their music is fresh but timeless playful experimental electronics full of colors and surprises.  
  
Boom Edan, the dream that Tuukka Asplund had, playes anti-grooves of queasy serenity. Gloriously bizarre, like a free jazz band bubbling through a fish tank filter. Music that diffuses with its own perversely oneiric logic. (The Quietus)
