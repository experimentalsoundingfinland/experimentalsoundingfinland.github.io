What would Valentine’s Day be without a dose of romantic noise?  
Once again this year, you can get just that at Ääniasema, where not only the house band Pompeijin Tuho will take the stage, but also Ërsh, currently residing in Jyväskylä, and Mathieu Sylvestre, flying in from Berlin. Each of them brings along a delightfully unruly noise arsenal hidden in their pouch, so grab a friend by the arm and come soak in the atmosphere! The evening end with an open jam session, so bring your own noisemakers.
