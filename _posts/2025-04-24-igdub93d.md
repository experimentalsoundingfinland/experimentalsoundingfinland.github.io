Join us for an evening of sonic experimentations with performances by Irish based sound artists Natalia Beylis and Willie Stewart bringing you a mix of psychic topography, kitchen sink mysticism, and moss-covered minimalism  
  
Natalia Beylis and Willie Stewart are at the forefront of Irelandâ€™s experimental music scene, creating immersive atmospheric compositions that blur the lines between folk traditions, ambient soundscapes and avant-garde improvisation.  Beylis, a renowned composer and field recordist, has been praised for her deeply textured sound worlds drawing inspiration from natural environments and found sounds.  Stewart, a key figure in experimental percussion and sound art, has collaborated with Beylis on numerous projects.
