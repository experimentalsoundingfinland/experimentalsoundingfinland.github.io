TK ensemble • silent night  
  
Toinen Kerros ensemble is a freshly formed open collective that was born out of the need to explore and perform experimental music works. At the heart of this ensemble is listening, experimentation, interpretation and discussion, emphasising that other than a pair of ears and mind of questions, there is no need for prior knowledge in music or instrument playing. Being the house band of the experimental sonic arts space Toinen Kerros, the ensemble is open to all sonic arts enthusiasts, lovers or anyone curious for sound experiments.   
  
Silent night is a Christmas concert dedicated to open scores written by Jürg Frey, Sarah Hennies, Tim Parkinson.  
  
Sunday, December 14th, 19:00, Toinen Kerros, Nokiantie 2-4   
  
Rehearsals take place every Sunday at 17:30. Contact us if you’re interested to join the ensemble: simonespampinato@[ik.me](http://ik.me)
