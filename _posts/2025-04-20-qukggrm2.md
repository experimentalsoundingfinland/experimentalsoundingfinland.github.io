New small-ensemble groupings are highlighted each time, with an emphasis on surprise, difference, curiosity, energy, and connection.

About the performers:  
LIVIA SCHWEIZER (b.1994) is a flutist, improvisor, educator and artistic researcher based in Helsinki. She is known for her interest in improvisation and non- conventional music notation as a tool of bringing together creative souls from different backgrounds and cultures. After graduating from the conservatory of Livorno (Italy), attracted by the Finnish contemporary music scene, Livia moved to Helsinki to study at the Sibelius Academy with Mikael Helasvuo. Since moving to Helsinki Livia has been working as a versatile freelancer working for example as a flutist for Korvat Auki, Eloa, Turku Philarmonic Orchestra, Lahti Symphony Orchestra, Jyväskylä Sinfonia, Pori Sinfonietta, Tapiola Sinfonietta and Avanti!. Now Livia is member of the E.C.I.O. – European Composers Improvisers Orchestra, and she is one of the founders of the Earth Ears Ensemble; a Helsinki-based group dedicated to performing new music written by lesser-known composers. In parallel to her work as a flutist freelancer Livia is a music teacher for the International School of Helsinki Finland, and she is a doctoral candidate at the Sibelius Academy. Her artistic research focuses on how non-conventional notation can be used to foster intercultural collaborations in contemporary music.
