Judith Hamann is performer/composer from Naarm/Melbourne who has long been recognized one of Australia's foremost contemporary cellists, and as a composer who “destroys the fiction of the musician who lives and works outside conventional parameters”. Their performance spans through various genres, including elements of contemporary classical, improvised and even pop music.  
  
In their recent research, Judith examines the acts of shaking and humming as formal and intimate encounters. They look at collapse as a generative imaginary surface; and explore the de-mastering of bodies, both human and non-human, in settler-colonial heritage instrumental practice and pedagogy.
