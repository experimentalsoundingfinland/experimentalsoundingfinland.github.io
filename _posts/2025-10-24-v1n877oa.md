Free Music Lovers Duo  
Markku Toikkanen – guitars, electronics, etc.,  
Timo Pyhälä – short-scale upright bass, etc.  
  
"We love the freedom that modern improvisation brings to probe the exciting world created by new kinds of instruments, where all sounds are equal or at least allowed. Non-idiomaticity and atonality, surprise, spontaneous structures - and the lack of structures - attract the mind to freely explore the boundaries of the subconscious, which traditional western music, in its predictability, may inhibit."

Wilson Tanner Smith - cello, electronics, objects, vocals  
Vesa Lehko - saxophone, clarinet, objects  
  
Wilson Tanner Smith plays improvisations rooted in a sensitive approach to the cello and its extended sounding possibilities, drawing from influences across free improvisation, free jazz, and deep listening approaches.  
Vesa Lehko plays saxophones and clarinets and is interested in finding new ways of playing and making music with objects and sounds found in his own environment.  
He also organizes the Rahina club in Merihaka Kylätupa.  
Smith and Lehko have performed together in concerts by the Helsinki Improvisers Orchestra, but this is their first time performing as a duo.
