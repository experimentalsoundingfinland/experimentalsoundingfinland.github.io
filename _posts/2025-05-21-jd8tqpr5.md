Daniel Malpikka: Launching at the unsettling milieu of both Helsinki and Mexico City‚Äôs poetry and art scenes, Malpikka has emerged as a transatlantic author in the literature and multimedia domains while exploring the intersections of language, graphic design, and digital expression. As a multimedia artist and curator, Malpikka has been involved in developing cutting-edge transdisciplinary literary productions across Europe, the Nordics, and Mexico. His work has been featured and commissioned for venues such as the Contemporary Art Museum of Helsinki (Kiasma) and the Helsinki International Artist Programme (Hiap). Malpikka served as editor and designer of Radiador Magazine. He was a member of the board of directors of the Finnish PEN and the artistic director of the Copenhagen Literature Festival.  
  
Lauri Hyv√§rinen is a Helsinki-based artist whose work is situated in the intersection of improvisation and electroacoustic composition. His recent work examines and exposes the  
relationships between place, memory, documentation and process. Live he uses a predetermined range of minimalist tools to reference the surrounding spatial and acoustic aspects to create sound textures that evolve spontaneously in-situ. His discography includes several solo and collaborative releases on labels in Japan, Europe and US, including Ftarri, NUNC. and Dinzu Artefacts. His latest solo release Cut Contexts, a  
series of multilocational and processual electroacoustic compositions was released in November 2021 by Intonema.  
  
The Global Interdisciplinary Improvisation Ensemble embraces students from the different programs at the Uniarts Helsinki, in order to develop skills for creating multidisciplinary performances in real time. By merging together diverse artistic and cultural backgrounds, as well as different genres and levels of expertise, the ensemble displays a unique way of creating improvised pieces in different line-ups. For this occasion, the ensemble brings along a set full of sonic and performative experiences collected by the interaction of its members during an intensive course-laboratory period conducted by Sergio Castrill√≥n during the end of the spring.  
  
HELSINKI EXPERIMENTAL SERIES 2024/2025 is a Community Engagement/Action Research/Artistic Research project, that intends to establish an interaction space for members of the different communities of improvisers based or working in Helsinki.  
  
The HES 2024/2025 series is developed and funded in collaboration with: Forum Box Gallery, The Global Music Department of the Sibelius Academy, Interkult (Kassandra ry), and the KONE Foundation. The research, curatorial, and artistic direction component of this project is run by Sergio Castrill√≥n.  
The event poster is designed by artist Fabu Pires.
