This concert, held in the Organo Hall of the Helsinki Music Centre, will propose different usages of the multiple organs present in the hall, thanks to the presence within the METRIC network of teachers and students active in performing organ and other historical keyboard instruments. However, different styles of improvisation will be presented, bringing the organ tradition to meet recent experimental practices.
