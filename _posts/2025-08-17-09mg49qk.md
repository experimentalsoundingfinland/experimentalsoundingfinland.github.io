Josefiina Vannesluoma is a Turku-born vocalist, flutist, and composer. Her artistic expression reflects a deep interest in interdisciplinary art and a curiosity toward different musical cultures. She leads several genre-defying ensembles, such as Signe, which performs experimental vocal music; Mortal Lease, a chamber jazz group; and Nossa Bossa, a bossa nova band. Her clear and luminous upper register can also be heard in Mikko Sarvanne Garden, the ensemble that won the 2023 Teosto Prize.  
  
Vannesluoma has been named the Artist of the Year 2025 by the Turku Jazz Festival.  
  
    “The star of the strongly avant-garde, yet still richly jazz-infused and engaging performance was vocalist Josefiina Vannesluoma, who at times sounded like an opera singer and often embodied wildly different personas with her voice. At her most extreme, she held entire conversations alone in completely invented languages, with intonation and nuance so astonishingly refined — and genuinely entertaining to watch.”
