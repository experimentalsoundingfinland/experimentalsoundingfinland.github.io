Hamidreza Keshvarpajuh, or PAJUH, is an artist from Tehran, Iran, whose creative practices span a variety of roles, including saxophonist, producer, improviser, and curator. Rooted in  
Tehran&#39;s alternative music scene, his work resonates across a spectrum of projects, including Obad, Block Project, and Berenj Ensemble. His saxophone playing is a delicate investigation of sound phenomenology, where tone and texture converge into a deeply tactile experience. Sound emerges from the friction between breath, resonance, and the body itself, shaped by a precise sensitivity to dynamics and tonal color. His compositions intertwine influences from minimalism, progressive structures, Nu jazz, and the intricate rhythms and melodies of Middle Eastern music, balancing repetition and variation to evoke a nuanced sense of space and time. Recently, PAJUH has expanded his focus to sound art, reconfiguring the  
saxophone‚Äôs physicality into a fluid, malleable sonic entity. In this new phase, he explores the liminal spaces between sound and silence, using extended techniques to stretch the boundaries of musical syntax and reimagine the interrelationship between voice, instrument, and objects.  
  
HELSINKI EXPERIMENTAL SERIES 2024/2025 is a Community Engagement/Action Research/Artistic Research project, that intends to establish an interaction space for members of the different communities of improvisers based or working in Helsinki  
.  
The HES 2024/2025 series is developed and funded in collaboration with: Forum Box Gallery, The Global Music Department of the Sibelius Academy, Interkult (Kassandra ry), and the KONE Foundation. The research, curatorial, and artistic direction component of this project is run by Sergio Castrill√≥n.  
The event poster is designed by artist Fabu Pires.
