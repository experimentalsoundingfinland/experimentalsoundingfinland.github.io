Experience the expanded sound world of the organ with NYKY Ensemble: cyborg-like sonorities, rhythmic power, and spatial dialogue.  
  
In this concert, the sound world of the organ is expanded as if creating a kind of cyborg-organ — not only through electronics and digital technology, as in the concert’s title piece, but also by placing the instrument in highly varied ensembles, from duos to a large ensemble.  
  
The organ’s site-specific nature is challenged in diverse sonic and rhythmic environments, where the organ’s kindred instruments — the accordion and the Hammond organ — also take on their own roles.  
  
The opening work, Crossover Concerto (2017) by Polish composer Mikołaj Majkusiak, is an energetic and rhythmically compelling piece for an ensemble that includes, in addition to a string quartet and wind instruments, accordion, piano, percussion, EWI (Electronic Wind Instrument), electric guitar, and Hammond organ.  
  
German composer Isabel Mundry’s Traces des Moments (2000) for string trio, clarinet, and accordion sounds like an illuminated moment. The wave-like movements found in nature — such as wind-created patterns in sand or water — resonate, reflect, mirror, and shadow one another, forming moving shapes in time.  
  
From small gestures arise large figures — as in American composer Nico Muhly’s Beaming Music (2002) for marimba and organ, where rhythmic motion takes on a very different form. Short rhythmic cells transform into broad, open harmonies.  
  
Matti Laine, a composition student at the Sibelius Academy, has written a new piece for organ, accordion, electric guitar, and tenor saxophone for this concert. In this quartet, the instruments are placed far apart, and the accordion functions as a kind of distant organ pipe, engaging in a wave-like dialogue with the organ.  
  
The concert concludes with Veli Kujala’s CybOrgan — an intense, multi-dimensional sound journey that moves freely between stylistic influences, from medieval organum to the avant-garde, at times with improvisatory hues. Together with the string orchestra and electronics, the organ forms a breathing organism.
