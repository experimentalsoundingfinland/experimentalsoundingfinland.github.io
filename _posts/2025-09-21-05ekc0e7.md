Sunday night improvised music madness!!  
Line-up:  
Beat Keller - feedbacker guitar  
Jukka Kääriäinen - electric guitar  
The collaboration between Beat Keller (CH) and Jukka Kääriäinen (FIN) began in 2022 when they met in Berlin. Their unique sound blends two distinct guitar styles, incorporating various extended techniques and preparations. Beat Keller is renowned for his extraordinary use of a custom-built feedback guitar, while Jukka Kääriäinen has developed his sound around extended techniques and DIY guitar pedals. Their first tour took place in Finland in 2023, during which they also recorded their debut album. Since then, they've performed in Berlin, Zurich, and Tallinn.  
Both Keller and Kääriäinen are well-established and active members of the experimental music community. They are known for their numerous collaborations and contributions to groups such as TWo DoGS (Joke Lanz & Beat Keller), Axel Dörner, Saadet Türköz, KFE (Keller/Friedli/Eden), Kazuhisa Uchihashi, Sähkökitarakvartetti, Mikko Innanen, Kalle Kalima, Harri Sjöström, and many more.
