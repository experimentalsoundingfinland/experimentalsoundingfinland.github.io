KIPPIS KOKEILU: Climara Forte + Semot Semot Posa + Ján Števuliak + Richard Hronský + u.n.o  
  
If people never experimented, we’d still be sitting in the cold, not warming ourselves by the fire.  
  
The idea of celebrating improvisation sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? Well, we’ve decided to make one of our [own.Ours](http://own.Ours) is a mix as colorful and unpredictable as a stew made from the leftovers of different musical kitchens - or a home-brewed, unfiltered heavy beer with a hint of something synthetic. Still, the natural color and flavor of it all won’t be [lost.With](http://lost.With) a broad lineup of young musicians stretching between Finland and Slovakia, between classical and experimental music, professionalism and pure amateur joy - across all the bright frequencies of sound and instrument combinations - we’ll cook up a real goulash of sound. Care to come and have a taste?
