The music of the Nuo Nuohoojat trio is created through free improvisation. Central to the band's expression are small, delicate, and incomplete sounds. The small sounds are treated as if they were decimals of whole sounds. Thus, the whole sounds are the sum of their parts, the combined result of the musicians' gestures and interaction. The Nuo Nuohoojat trio's first performance was heard at the Kaekuu festival in Sammatti in July 2025. The band consists of Jaakko Kuikka (shakuhachi, saxophone), Melik Turunen (synthesizer), Johanna Vahtola (voice, percussions)
