At PARATIISI Club's experimental music Äänikylpy evening, Jukka Kääriäinen, Mikko Innanen, and Sam Ospovat will perform.  
  
Jukka Kääriäinen is a musician focused on experimental music. Depending on the situation, his instruments range from prepared acoustic guitar to electric guitar accompanied by a backpack full of effects.  
  
Mikko Innanen is a saxophonist, composer, and bandleader from Finland, currently based in Helsinki. A versatile and open-minded musician, Innanen thrives on the borders of jazz’s past, present, and future — whether it’s freely improvised solos, duos or trios, performing his own compositions, or interpreting the music of others.  
  
Sam Ospovat is a drummer and composer interested in the intersections of new rhythmic structures and improvisation. After immersing himself in 20th-century percussion music and Haitian Voodoo drumming, Ospovat developed compositional forms that resemble Calder’s mobiles.
