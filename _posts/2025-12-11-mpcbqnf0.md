In the fourth edition of Suhina Klubi for the fall 2025, we are proud to host Antti Lötjönen & Katariin Raska.   
  
Antti Lötjönen is one of the central figures in Finnish jazz – a versatile bassist and composer who has been a prominent presence at the forefront of Finnish jazz for over two decades. He has performed in more than 30 countries and played on over a hundred recordings.  
  
Katariin Raska is a multi-instrumentalist and improviser based in Tallinn, Estonia. Intrigued by the esthetics of her instruments and their playing possibilities, her projects often have a common link with traditional music and free improvisation.  
  
She is one of the front figures in Estonian jaws harp music and the pioneer of improvisational music on Estonian bagpipes.  
  
Concert starts at 19.00  
Tickets: 15€/8
