Heli Hartikainen is an award-winning, boundary-breaking saxophonist, composer, and sound artist. One of the boldest improvisers in Finland’s experimental and ambient jazz scene, Hartikainen creates music where sonic textures, abstractions, concepts, and evolving soundscapes playfully intertwine. Their work stands as a powerful testament to the possibilities of artistic experimentation.  
In their solo concert at the Kirpilä Art Collection, Hartikainen will perform new music created with the use of a specially customized sampling software.  
There are 35 seats available for advance booking online. On the day of the concert, the first 10 people at the door will be admitted, or more if seats remain.  
  
Free admission. Registration opens on this event page on 1 November 2025.
