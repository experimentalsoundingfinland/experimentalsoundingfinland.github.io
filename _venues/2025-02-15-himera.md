We are an artist run work group organizing concerts, a yearly festival of experimental and other musics in Turku. We have also been involved in other activities such as listening groups, workshops and lectures as well as shared artistic work. The core of our activities is joy, work, politics and the love of sound.  
  
A nomadic organization, Himera collaborates with local spaces and organizations such as Ehkä-tuotanto/Kutomo, Titanik, Sibelius Museum, Tehdas-teatteri, B-galleria, Turku City Library and Bar Ö. We are actively working to create a collaborative and communal spirit in our local arts scene where everyone is welcome.  
  
Himera got started in the end of 2012 and we organized our first event in February 2013. Current members are Niko-Matti Ahti, Marja Ahti, Antti Tolvi and Rasmus Östling.
