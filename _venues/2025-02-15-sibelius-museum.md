Our goal is to bring to life the history of Finnish music from the 18th century to the present day and let all forms of music flourish within our walls. Parts of the vast instrument collection of the museum are exhibited in our temporary exhibition to provide viewpoints into the history of music as well as its making, playing and performing. Temporary exhibitions also provide spaces for audiovisual and sound art.  
  
We have an extensive archive, mainly focused on Finnish music and culture, used regularly by researchers around the world. We have started digitising our archives to make it more available to everyone.  
  
Our concert series, Sibbe Live! and Fredagar p√• Sibbe, offer live music and unexpected musical encounters in our own concert hall.  
  
Welcome to the most comprehensive museum of music in Finland!
