This website offers a shared **[community calendar](index.md)** for the activities of the **[creative sonic communities](#rules-and-criteria)** active in Finland.
It is a place to share our events (performances, workshops, etc.), to contact the venues and organisers, and to strengthen our community. The calendar is a free community service and will always remain free. The calendar and venues list content will be always fully and freely available for everybody.
