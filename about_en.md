## About
This website offers a **[calendar](index.md)** for the activities of the **[creative sonic communities](#rules-and-criteria)** active in Finland.
It is a place to view and share events, to connect with the venues and organisers, and to strengthen our community. 

The calendar is a free community service and will always remain free. The calendar content and the venues list will be always fully and freely available for everybody.

## Important!

The underlying calendar, the venue list, and the forms are realised using free tools provided by Google. The website is hosted on Github. As soon as possible we will substitute those with open-source alternatives, and host the website on an EU-based hosting service.
