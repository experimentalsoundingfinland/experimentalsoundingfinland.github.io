## About
This website offers a shared **[community calendar](index.md)** for the activities of the **[creative sonic communities](#rules-and-criteria)** active in Finland.
It is a place to view and share events, to connect with the venues and organisers, and to strengthen our community. 

The calendar is a free community service and will always remain free. The calendar content and the venues list will be always fully and freely available for everybody.

---

## Archives
The archive of the venues and organisers list is available at the **[venues and organisers page](venues.md)**

The archive of the calendar is under construction.
